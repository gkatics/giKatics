                    <h3>Redesigning a project from the past</h3>
                    <p>I've decided to practice, reflect and measure how much I've grown as a designer by redesigning one of my past projects. The intention was to give a fresh look and feel to the app and add some new features. Reflecting, I realize I did a good job with the knowledge I had back then. But, wow, the past me didn't believe in documentation.
                    Upon opening the old files, I found that none of my decisions were documented. It took me a huge amount of time to understand what I had done, why is this, why this style. This lack of documentation led to inconsistencies in the UI and confusion in the UX, which became evident once I started writing down the project's rules and principles. Creating the system for that project became the real challenge. The freesh feel I was looking for it, was mainly solved by fixing the inconsistency of the project.
                    The tool of choice is crucial for the scalability of the documentation itself. Named objects and layers in Figma plus writing information on Notion was the best choice for this experiment.
                    The key learning from this exercise is that taking the time to document decisions upfront saves time by ensuring consistency and scalability in a project.

                        <p>BeMySpace aims to match rehearsal spaces with performing artists. In the app, dancers can book a place with the necessary appliances and dance everywhere.
                        The client briefed their idea and the business needs. The project started with an understanding of the market and its possible users. The app didn't have a direct competitor, but to understand more about the marketplace patterns, similar apps were studied ‚Äìlike Airbnb.<br>
                        The first user journey to be tested was the user profile, the dancer looking for a place. Adjustments were done and then the same was done for the host persona. The UX was the next step, with a usability test to understand the critical steps. Then the UI and the creation of the brand look and feel. It was a complex project as it mixes host and guest profiles.<br>
                        The logo crowed the branding and it was conceptualized to bring dance movements into shaped form.<br>

                The book is a visual and animated journey to explain ‚Äìor tried to‚Äì, why we feel and why we have emotions. In 6 chapters, the narrative is built will illustrations, collages and animations. The minimalist use of colours links with the atmosphere of the feeling on each page. Emotions are bonded to music, and the title of the chapters is a homage to The Beatle's songs. The songs were chosen by the feeling they spread and the star emotion of each chapter.

            <h3>Create generative (he)artworks</h3>
            <p><b>heart/work</b> is the only iOS app that generates original artwork based on your unique health information. Bridging the gap between well-being and health data, <b>heart/work</b> creates layered visuals to provide at-a-glance synopsis using meditative breathing exercises, your heartbeat, health data from the Apple Watch and environmental data from your current surroundings.<br>
            The project was developed in 3 months by a team formed by Marco Falanga, Ottavio Gelone, Baldev Ghelani, Giselle Katics, Mikey Krieger and Moritz Philip Recke. <b>heart/work</b> was the graduation project in the Apple Developer Academy in Napoli, Italy.

                <h3>Redesign for DanceMe+ iOS app</h3>
                <p>DanceMe+ is an iOS app that supports and encourages dance innovation. Through the app, dancers can create their studio, upload videos and share experiences about their performances.<br>
                The vision of the app was clear, but the design was not intuitive. The starting point for this project was understanding the needs of the users and the client. The word for it was consistency. Consistency in the visual elements of the interface but mainly in the experience of the app, which was described as chaotic and confusing for some users. The flows and the architecture of the app were heavily reshaped to bring ease and pleasure. As requested by the client, new features were added while keeping consistent with the DanceMe brand.<br>

                        <h3>Winner WWDC18 scholarship application</h3>
                        <p>Memory can be defined as the <i>"mental capacity of retaining and reviving facts, events, impressions and recalling previous experiences"</i>. But I wonder,  how do we transform an event into a memory? After the chemical and neurons work, why do we record some events and forget others? <br>
                        The scientific and emotional aspects were the starting point of my research for this project. The Playground Book unriddle why and how we record a particular event and transform it into a memory. Sometimes good memories, sometimes not-so-lucky ones. The narrative uses illustration, collage, animations and my personal narrative to tell the history of how to create a memory. The book has 5 chapters and pursues a path to explain how a moment became a memory, where is stored in our brain and the magical change this memory suffers every time we recall them.<br>
                        The Playground was developed as part of the <b>winner's application</b> to the WWDC18 scholarship program. Was completely coded, designed, illustrated and written by me.

                            <h3>NoiseGate is the first iOS app that focuses exclusively on the dangerous impact of noise pollution on health and mental wellbeing</h3>
                            <p>The app was developed by a group of master class students of the <b>Apple Developer Academy</b> in Napoli, Italy, and is available for free on the Apple App Store. With it, users can measure and understand the actual noise level in their current position and obtain further analysis to make better decisions on avoiding high noise levels over time. Simultaneously, all users contribute as "citizen scientists" by creating a global map of noise level distribution. <br>
                            One of the core elements of the app ‚Äìdesigned by Giselle Katics and Giovanni Monaco‚Äì is accessibility. The colour palette was carefully defined to be colour-blind-friendly and follows HIG standards for a native experience. The iconography was designed to translate the decibel level to mundane objects, creating a clear understanding of the noise itself. <br>
                            The team ‚ÄìLucas Assis Rodrigues, Rany Azevedo, Maddalena Granata, Giovanni Monaco, Giselle Katics and Moritz Philip Recke‚Äì are satisfied with the product: "In just 1 month we have analyzed over 45.000 seconds of noise. And the most exciting figure is the locations of sound measurements: London, New York, S√£o Paulo, Dubai, Hong Kong, Brisbane and even Luanda, Angola. We have virtually covered the 5 continents".</p>
